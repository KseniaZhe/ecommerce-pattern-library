The buttons use our primary colour to attract the user and to make him feel comfortable and press them. Each button has a specific purpose:

- The regular buttons are for cards, forms, banners.
- The ghost buttons are for write a review buttons and for buttons with lesser importance.
- The light ghost buttons are for buttons with lesser importance on dark backgrounds.
